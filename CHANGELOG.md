# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Security

- Hardened the Android loopback gateway so it refuses broad WebView proxy fallback when host-scoped reverse-bypass support is unavailable.
- Restricted loopback gateway handling to active HNS host/subdomain scope and rejected non-HNS proxy traffic with fail-closed responses.
- Removed release stack-trace printing from the loopback accept path and kept diagnostics bounded through the gateway event log.

### Changed

- Updated `androidx.activity:activity-ktx` from `1.12.0-alpha05` to stable `1.13.0`.
- Updated production-readiness and security-model documentation for the stricter loopback proxy posture.

### Fixed

- Made the Android FFI live-proof cache-miss test deterministic by persisting the synthetic peer height before selection.
- Addressed the current Rust clippy warning in the Android FFI fallback marker.
